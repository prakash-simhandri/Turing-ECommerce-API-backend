# Turing-ECommerce-API-backend website

In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS.Here's the [swagger](https://backendapi.turing.com/docs/),but you need to pass the test for it first [here](https://developers.turing.com/dashboard/challenge).

  I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the customer is valid or not. We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.

## The Requirements
## Installation process and Execution

First and foremost, If you'are using Linux-based-OS, open your terminal and install the latest version of <b>NodeJS</b> and <b>npm</b>. You do also need to install <b>mysql</b> database onto your system. by writing the following commands. 
This will install <b>NodeJS version-12</b> and <b>npm version-6</b> on your system.
```
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install curl
   sudo apt install build-essential apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates curl
   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt install nodejs
```
Next, you've to install mysql-database onto your system. For this, write these following commands on your terminal. 

```
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```
You can also check the version of NodeJS and npm by writing, `node -v` and `npm -v` on the terminal respectively. <br>
Next, you need to make a clone of this repository and get into the repository on your terminal. Now, you need to install the required dependencies from your `package.json` file. For this, you've to write `sudo npm install`. <br>

There is a `tshirtshop.sql file` already present in the *database/* folder. You have to *import* this file to an empty database. For this, make a new database first, and navigate to the *database/* directory and then write the following commands: <br>
Import the schema using `mysql -u <user_name> -p <database_name> < tshirtshop.sql`<br>
For checking the data, log into your user, by writing `mysql -u <user_name> -p`. You would be asked for your password. Now, you can use database with all its tables' data. <br> 

Next, navigate to the folder where, `server.js` file is located. You can start the local server by writing `node server.js` on the terminal. <br>
You can always kill your running port by writing, `killall -9 node` on the terminal. <br>
Now, you need to install postman, that helps you to develop APIs and getting responses from it, by writing the following commands on your terminal.
```
 sudo apt-get install snap
 snap install postman
```
## Happy Coding :)
