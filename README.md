# Turing-ECommerce-API-backend website

In this project, I have made a backend of an e-commerce website using Express framework of NodeJS.Here's the [swagger](https://backendapi.turing.com/docs/),but you need to pass the test for it first [here](https://developers.turing.com/dashboard/challenge).'\n'
  I have also used JWT-authentication token to verify the if the customer is valid or not. We are already given the mysql-database in which there are different tables and their data. We've to write different queries for different endpoints to make them working.
